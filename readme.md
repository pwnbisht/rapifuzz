## ðŸ“– Description

The **Incident Management System** is a RESTful API-based application designed to manage incidents efficiently. Built with **Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF)**, it provides a secure backend for user registration, authentication, and incident tracking. The system supports token-based authentication. It is developed to meet the requirements of creating, viewing, and editing incidents with user-specific access controls.

   - Registration with required fields: email, first name, last name, country code, mobile, address, country, state, city, and pin code.
   - Email-based authentication with token generation.
- **Incident Management**:
    - Create, view, and edit incidents with auto-generated unique IDs (e.g., RMG123452024).
